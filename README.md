## 🏰 Origin Story

Like many aspiring devs, I once wandered the internet in search of quality interview prep—only to be met with repetitive, low-quality, and fragmented content.  
So, I decided to forge **one complete arena** where developers could:

- Face endless unique coding questions
- Practice in multiple formats
- Get instant, detailed feedback
- Track progress over time

The mission: **Make interview prep a quest worth embarking on.**
